# Docker container for Transmission via openvnp



## Usage 

The best way to use this container is to use it with docker-compose (see [docker-compose example](./docker-compose%20example))

Read the docker-compose.yml file and edit it following your needs:
- [#22](././docker-compose%20example/docker-compose.yml#L22): set the path to your .ovpn file (containing the certificates)
- [#23](././docker-compose%20example/docker-compose.yml#L23): set the path where all the torrents folders will be:
    - /downloads
    - /incomplete
    - /watch
- [#24](././docker-compose%20example/docker-compose.yml#L24): set the path to your own transmission settings.json file (there is one under the [settings folder](./settings) /!\ read below)

The [settings folder](./settings) contains:
- a ready to use nginx.conf file (you may consider to change the ```listen 8080``` line to another port)
- an editable settings file for transmission
    - /!\ do not edit the ```#bind-address-ipv4#``` placeholder!
    - set a user name and password at lines [#46](./settings/transmission.json#L46) and [#47](./settings/transmission.json#L47)

### First launch

Use the following command: 
``` 
docker-compose -f /path/to/the/docker-compose.yml up
```

Look at the logs to see if anything wrong is happening.

If everything looks ok, type your server address at port 8080 (or the port you specified for nginx configuration): you should be invited to type a login and a password then access to the Transmission web interface.
